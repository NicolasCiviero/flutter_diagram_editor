# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on maintaining and updating the documentation (Memory Bank) for the `shape_editor` project. The agent has just initialized the memory bank.

## Recent Changes
- **Initialization**: Created the initial set of Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## Active Tasks
- [x] Initialize Memory Bank
- [x] Analyze Clustering Logic
- [ ] Refactor Clustering Logic (Extract to Policy)
- [ ] Review library core functionality (ongoing/future)

## Open Questions
- Are there specific custom implementations of this library currently being worked on by the user, or is the user maintaining the library itself? (Context implies maintaining the library).
