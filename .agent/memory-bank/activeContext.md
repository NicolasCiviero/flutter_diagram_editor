## Current Focus
The current focus is on maintaining and updating the documentation (Memory Bank) for the `shape_editor` project. The agent has just initialized the memory bank.

## Recent Changes
- **Refactoring**: Moved vertex clustering logic from `CanvasModel` to `ClusteringPolicy`.
- **Initialization**: Created the initial set of Memory Bank files.

## Active Tasks
- [x] Analyze Clustering Logic
- [x] Refactor Clustering Logic (Extract to Policy)
- [ ] Review library core functionality (ongoing/future)

## Open Questions
- Are there specific custom implementations of this library currently being worked on by the user, or is the user maintaining the library itself? (Context implies maintaining the library).
